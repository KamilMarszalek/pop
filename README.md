In each cell of a rectangular board of size 4Ã—n, an integer z<sub>ij</sub> is written.  
You are given *m* cards that must be placed on the board.  
A valid placement requires that no two cards occupy cells that are adjacent vertically or horizontally.

Your task is to find such a placement of the cards on the board that the sum of the numbers in the occupied cells is maximized.  
You do not have to use all of the cards.
